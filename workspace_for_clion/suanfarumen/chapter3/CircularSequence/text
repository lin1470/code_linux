1584 Circular Sequence
Some DNA sequences exist in circular forms as in the following
figure, which shows a circular sequence “CGAGTCAGCT”, that
is, the last symbol “T” in “CGAGTCAGCT” is connected to the first
symbol “C”. We always read a circular sequence in the clockwise
direction.
Since it is not easy to store a circular sequence in a computer
as it is, we decided to store it as a linear sequence. However, there
can be many linear sequences that are obtained from a circular
sequence by cutting any place of the circular sequence. Hence, we
also decided to store the linear sequence that is lexicographically
smallest among all linear sequences that can be obtained from a
circular sequence.
Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest sequence
from a given circular sequence. For the example in the figure, the
lexicographically smallest sequence is “AGCTCGAGTC”. If there are two or more linear sequences that are
lexicographically smallest, you are to find any one of them (in fact, they are the same).
Input
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T is given on the first line of the input
file. Each test case takes one line containing a circular sequence that is written as an arbitrary linear
sequence. Since the circular sequences are DNA sequences, only four symbols, ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ and ‘T’, are
allowed. Each sequence has length at least 2 and at most 100.
Output
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line is to contain the lexicographically smallest sequence
for the test case.
