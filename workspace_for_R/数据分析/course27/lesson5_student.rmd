### Third Qualitative Variable
Notes:
Write code to create a new data frame,
# called 'pf.fc_by_age_gender', that contains
# information on each age AND gender group.

# The data frame should contain the following variables:

#    mean_friend_count,
#    median_friend_count,
#    n (the number of users in each age and gender grouping)

# Here is an example of the structure of your data frame. Your
# data values will be different. Note that if you are grouping by
# more than one variable, you will probably need to call the
# ungroup() function. 

#   age gender mean_friend_count median_friend_count    n
# 1  13 female          247.2953                 150  207
# 2  13   male          184.2342                  61  265
# 3  14 female          329.1938                 245  834
# 4  14   male          157.1204                  88 1201


```{r Third Qualitative Variable}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
pf <- read.csv('/home/bruce/Desktop/data_analysis/r语言/r_courses/EDA_Course_Materials/EDA_Course_Materials/lesson3/pseudo_facebook.tsv',sep = '\t')
pf.fc_by_age_gender <- pf %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%
  group_by(age,gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_friend_count = mean(friend_count),
            median_friend_count = median(friend_count),
            n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(age)
head(pf.fc_by_age_gender)
```

***

### Plotting Conditional Summaries
Notes:
# Create a line graph showing the
# median friend count over the ages
# for each gender. Be sure to use
# the data frame you just created,
# pf.fc_by_age_gender.
```{r Plotting Conditional Summaries}
ggplot(aes(x =age,y =median_friend_count),data = pf.fc_by_age_gender)+ geom_line(aes(color = gender))
```

### Thinking in Ratios
Notes:

***

### Wide and Long Format
Notes:

***

### Reshaping Data
Notes:

```{r}
# install.packages('reshape2')
library(reshape2)
pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide <- dcast(pf.fc_by_age_gender,
                                  age ~ gender,
                                  value.var = 'median_friend_count')
head(pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide)
```


***

### Ratio Plot
Notes:
# Plot the ratio of the female to male median
# friend counts using the data frame
# pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide.

# Think about what geom you should use.
# Add a horizontal line to the plot with
# a y intercept of 1, which will be the
# base line. Look up the documentation
# for geom_hline to do that. Use the parameter
# linetype in geom_hline to make the
# line dashed.

# The linetype parameter can take the values 0-6:
# 0 = blank, 1 = solid, 2 = dashed
# 3 = dotted, 4 = dotdash, 5 = longdash
# 6 = twodash
```{r Ratio Plot}
ggplot(aes(x= age,y = female/male),data = pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide)+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1,linetype = 2)
```

***
 Create a variable called year_joined
# in the pf data frame using the variable
# tenure and 2014 as the reference year.

### Third Quantitative Variable
Notes:

```{r Third Quantitative Variable}
pf$year_joined <- floor(2014 - pf$tenure/365)
head(pf)
summary(pf$year_joined)
sum(is.na(pf$year_joined))
```

***

### Cut a Variable
Notes:
# Create a new variable in the data frame
# called year_joined.bucket by using
# the cut function on the variable year_joined.

# You need to create the following buckets for the
# new variable, year_joined.bucket

#        (2004, 2009]
#        (2009, 2011]
#        (2011, 2012]
#        (2012, 2014]

# Note that a parenthesis means exclude the year and a
# bracket means include the year.
```{r Cut a Variable}
pf$year_joined.bucket <- cut(pf$year_joined,breaks = c(2004,2009,2011,2012,2014))
```

***
# Create a line graph of friend_count vs. age
# so that each year_joined.bucket is a line
# tracking the median user friend_count across
# age. This means you should have four different
# lines on your plot.

# You should subset the data to exclude the users
# whose year_joined.bucket is NA.
### Plotting it All Together
Notes:

```{r Plotting it All Together}
ggplot(aes(x = age,y=friend_count),data = subset(pf,!is.na(year_joined.bucket)))+
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = median)
```

***

### Plot the Grand Mean
Notes:

```{r Plot the Grand Mean}
ggplot(aes(x = age,y=friend_count),data = subset(pf,!is.na(year_joined.bucket)))+
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = mean)+
  geom_line(stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = mean,
            linetype = 6)
```

***

### Friending Rate
Notes:

```{r Friending Rate}
with(subset(pf,tenure>1),summary(friend_count/tenure))
```

***

### Friendships Initiated
Notes:

What is the median friend rate?

What is the maximum friend rate?

# Create a line graph of mean of friendships_initiated per day (of tenure)
# vs. tenure colored by year_joined.bucket.

# You need to make use of the variables tenure,
# friendships_initiated, and year_joined.bucket.

# You also need to subset the data to only consider user with at least
# one day of tenure.
```{r Friendships Initiated}
ggplot(aes(x =tenure,y = friendships_initiated/tenure),
       data = subset(pf,tenure>1))+
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket))
```

***

### Bias-Variance Tradeoff Revisited
Notes:

```{r Bias-Variance Tradeoff Revisited}

ggplot(aes(x = tenure, y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure >= 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = 'summary',
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 7 * round(tenure / 7), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 30 * round(tenure / 30), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)

ggplot(aes(x = 90 * round(tenure / 90), y = friendships_initiated / tenure),
       data = subset(pf, tenure > 0)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year_joined.bucket),
            stat = "summary",
            fun.y = mean)
ggplot(aes(x =tenure,y = friendships_initiated/tenure),
       data = subset(pf,tenure>1))+
  geom_smooth(aes(color = year_joined.bucket))

```

### Histograms Revisited
Notes:

```{r Histograms Revisited}
yo <- read.csv('/home/bruce/Desktop/data_analysis/r语言/r_courses/EDA_Course_Materials/EDA_Course_Materials/lesson5/yogurt.csv')
str(yo)
yo$id <- factor(yo$id)
str(yo)
ggplot(aes(x = price),data = yo)+ geom_histogram()
```

***

### Number of Purchases
Notes:
# Create a new variable called all.purchases,
# which gives the total counts of yogurt for
# each observation or household.

# One way to do this is using the transform
# function. You can look up the function transform
# and run the examples of code at the bottom of the
# documentation to figure out what it does.

# The transform function produces a data frame
# so if you use it then save the result to 'yo'!

```{r Number of Purchases}
head(yo)
yo <- transform(yo,all.purchases = strawberry+blueberry+pina.colada+plain+mixed.berry )
```

***

### Prices over Time
Notes:

```{r Prices over Time}
ggplot(aes(x = time,y = price),data = yo)+ geom_jitter(alpha =1/10)
```

set.seed(123)
str(yo)
sample.ids <- sample(levels(yo$id),16)
sample.ids
ggplot(aes(x = time,y =price),data = subset(yo,id %in% sample.ids))+ facet_wrap(~ id) + geom_point(aes(size =all.purchases),pch =1)+ geom_line()
```
