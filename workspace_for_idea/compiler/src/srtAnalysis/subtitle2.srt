1 
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
The late fourth century A.D. the 
Roman Empire began to crumble.

2 
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its lustre,...

3 
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
...possessed one of the Seven 
Wonders of the ancient world:...

4 
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,200
...the legendary lighthouse, 
and the biggest library known.

5 
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,800
The library was a not only 
cultural but a religious symbol,...

6 
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,800
a place where the pagans worshiped 
their ancestral gods.

7 
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,400
The traditional pagan worship 
in the city now coexisted...

8 
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable 
religion up to now banned,...

9 
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
...Christianity.

10 
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

11 
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,900
After taking the library, many 
pagans were converted...

12 
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,900
Hipatia continued teaching and 
researching,...

13 
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,900
...while his former students held...

14 
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,900
...important positions in the 
social elite.

15 
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,900
The empire was split in two forever.

16 
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,900
Many Christians saw this as a 
sign of the end of the world...

17 
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,900
...and decided to prepare by 
practicing a more holy life.

18 
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,400
The order of "Parabolanos" monks 
was charged to go...

19 
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,900
...through the streets and watch
for Christian morality...

20 
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,000
...now uneven by the presence
of the Jews.

21 
00:56:57,400 --> 00:01:23,400
The Library, years later.

22 
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
How many fools
have wondered 

23 
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,700
why not the stars fall
from the sky 

24 
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,800
<i> But you,
not happy to cease of the wise, </ i>

25 
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,300
<i> You know that the stars
do not move up or down. </ i>

26 
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,000
only reborn <i>
from east to west, </ i>

27 
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,500
<i> following the most perfect post
ever can see , </ i>

28 
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,300
<i> circle. </ i>

29 
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
Because the circle <i> reigns 
in heaven, </ i>

30 
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,200
<i> the stars would never have fallen
and never will. </ i>

31 
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,000
But what about here on Earth?

32 
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,900
Here, bodies do fall.

33 
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,100
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

34 
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,500
Look again.

35 
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,400
Again.

36 
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
No, leave it.

37 
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,700
So,

38 
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
<i> What mysterious wonder 
do you would think </ i>

39 
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,000
<i> that may lurk beneath the earth
for every single person and animal, </ i>

40 
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,900
<i> and object and all laid exact
on there</ i>

41 
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
What may should be?

42 
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,400
The highness, madame.

43 
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,700
No.

44 
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,300
Sinesio.

45 
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
The weighty.

46 
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,000
<i> No, you both speaking about the same thing,
but you not talking about primary course. </ i>

47 
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Has anyone ever thought about
your..

48 
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,700
your feet ...

49 
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,000
your feet

50 
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,400
<i> standing perched on the
very center of the cosmos </ i>

51 
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,200
that holds all things together,
pull them together

52 
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,200
If there is no center,
the universe would be

53 
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
deformed, infinite, formless,

54 
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
<i> chaotic. </ i>

55 
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,200
Doesn't matter that we were <i>
here, there or anywhere </ i>

56 
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,600
What you will do? That's right
never being born

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

58 
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,100
God, Our Father,

59 
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
lord of the universe,

60 
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
origin of all things,

61 
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,100
eternal force of the cosmos,

62 
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,100
where everything has
its beginning and its end.

63 
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
Mighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

64 
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,600
And all the gods Anubis
that protect us

65 
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,100
both in heaven
and on earth ...

66 
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,700
Something happens in the market.

67 
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,100
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

68 
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,100
Tell the master that we leave.

69 
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Can you believe. He was counting me
as the part of their conquests

70 
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,200
This Orestes also foolish
as his father.

71 
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,200
I have already suggested that you take
his heart to another muse

72 
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,900
one more beautiful than me.

73 
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,200
- Who?
The music.

74 
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,200
<i> Music </ i>

75 
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,500
He find his music.

76 
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,000
What happen 227 had become 
16 ?

77 
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,900
Divide  with 14.

78 
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,900
<i> They behave like humans!
Eat, drink and fornicate! </ I>

79 
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,000
If my gods <i> eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them </ i>

80 
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,500
Know this,

81 
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,700
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

82 
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,600
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

83 
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,400
Serapis!

84 
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,100
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

85 
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,000
for crown?

86 
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,300
Hey You, Christians, how arrogant you 
to take another

87 
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,800
Empire attitude like this

88 
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,700
My father's father saw them

89 
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,800
slaughtered at the circus

90 
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,500
and ate to the lions.

91 
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,100
Enough! Watch.

92 
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,000
Watch.

93 
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,800
You see now 
I walk cross the fire.

94 
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,300
If my god ...

95 
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,400
If my God is the true god,
I unscathed, no hurt.

96 
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
And if your gods exist,

97 
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
<i> they'll roast me like a pig. </ i>

98 
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,100
You ...

99 
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,300
You're lie!

100 
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,900
You'll burn!

101 
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
You will have what you deserve!

102 
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,400
Let's see if you can walk cross
the fire.

103 
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,200
What are you doing?

104 
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
<i> Stop, you can not do that!
Leave him alone. </ I>

105 
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,500
<i> Quiet! or you will follow. </ i>

106 
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
Who is this?

107 
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,500
Who is this?

108 
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,000
How many times should I
must repeat message?

109 
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Today,

110 
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
Christians
burn a man.

111 
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Right in the middle of agora!

112 
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,200
I will not have this in my house!

113 
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
Not in the house of Theon!

114 
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Give it to me.

115 
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Give it to me!

116 
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,900
No terrific mercy is way go

117 
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
- Davo!
Get up.

118 
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
You have nothing to do
with this.

119 
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,700
I do, i am a Christian.

120 
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,200
<i> What did you say? </ i>

121 
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,200
I do. I am a Christian
Punish both of us.

122 
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,800
So, now we'll presume to teach
us a mercy

123 
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Get a whip.
- Father!

124 
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,300
Calm ...

125 
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,300
Father, I beg you.
I begged you

126 
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,300
wrapped in.. in blazing, right?

127 
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,400
To the flames, stupid.

128 
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
<i> Why did not you burned like the heathen?
Tell me. </ I>

129 
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,600
Leave us ...

130 
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,800
Come here.

131 
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,300
Kneel.

132 
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
<i> Tell me, is true
you are a Christian? </ i>

133 
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,900
I do not know what to say, madame.
- Why not?

134 
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,400
If i say yes, that will be a lie

135 
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,300
If I said no, i lied to
my master and I do not know which is worse.

136 
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
Then say nothing.

137 
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,800
That's it.

138 
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you.

139 
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,400
<i> The master is very angry

140

What is that?

141 
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,900

Have you done?

147 
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Earth

148

149 
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,700

Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

Never disobeying
the law of the circle.Never

Ptolemy
told me show as do obey.

Well search, Davo.

164 
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
I like you do the explanation search even 
paying course attention or not

165 
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,600
One or two..up here

166 
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,800
I tell you The Gods should consulted
to me before they creating anything.

167 
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,900
Why say that?

168 
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
<i> It's all so whimsical! </ i>

169 
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,300
Why is the joint take of
two circles?

170 
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,000
Would not be more, perfect
if the wander is..

171 
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
if wander and a single circle
give sense to everything?

172 
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,300
What authority do you judge
the work of God?

173 
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,700
What is wrong with you, Christians?

174 
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,100
The man is no longer with brief mouth
in this city

175 
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,800
Could you decide creation, you could decide
a Lord, 

176 
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,300
and you offended.
You should move to the desert.

177 
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
You will not hear anything offensive there.

178 
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,800
You know nothing about you speak.
None of you.

179 
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,500
What this.. you can explain to all?

180 
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,800
What is the question?

181 
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,400
Just.. answer me.

182 
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,000
<i> If ...</ i>

183 
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,200
<i> if two things are equal
a third thing, </ i>

184 
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
and They are all equal to each other

185 
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,900
Well.

186 
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,100
Now, Are you are not similar to me?

187 
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,900
Yes

188 
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,600
And you, Orestes?

189 
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,900
Yes

190 
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,100
Now I am actually say with everybody 
here in this room, 

191 
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
More things you joint us 

192 
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,300
and divide us.

193 
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
<i> Whatever happens on the street,
we are brothers. </ i>

194 
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,300
We are brothers.

195 
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,200
Did you remember, the fights are a thing
of slaves and rabble.

196 
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Now We should give Davo's presentation
well applause

197 
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,900
We will judge all
a live and dead!

198 
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,200
And then it will be too late,

199 
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,100
because only those who believed in Jesus

200 
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
we'll be saved.

201 
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
What are you waiting for?

202 
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
What are you waiting for?

203 
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,400
<i> The Kingdom of God is near. </ i>

204 
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
Do you understand what 
I am telling to you?

205 
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800

who made the miracle?

213 
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,800
Do you want to see a miracle?

214 
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,000
Are you the one?

215 
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,400
I am.

216 
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
Come with me.

217 
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,500
Jesus traveled throughout Galilee

218 
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,800
teaching in their synagogues.

219 
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,500

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,600
or beauty in that.

331 
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,000
<i> Do not you agree? </ i>

332 
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,100
Yesterday we were discussing
the Apollonius cone.

333 
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,700
We speak of the circle,
of the ellipse and parabola.

334 
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,400
Today we see the hyperbola.
- Lady!

335 
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,300
<i> Forgive me, Lady. </ i>

336 
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,900
Olimpios requires your present

337 
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,100
urgently to Serapeum.

338 
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
To you as well.

339 
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,800
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

340 
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,800
Thank you, Lord.

341 
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,600
How is to enjoy that make us
swallow the faith

342 
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,500
and customs the people until 
recently were coming out rule?

343 
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,500
- What happened?
- It's a sacrilege!

344 
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,400
Christians
have met in the agora.

345 
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,400
They mocking the gods.

346 
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,900
Must stop
these insults!

347 
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,400
He may not fear him,

348 
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,500
But fear our swords!

349 
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Wait!

350 
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Wait!

351 
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,100
What is it you are going to do?

352 
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,700
Are you going to attack them?

353 
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Are you going to staying your hands 
with blood for an insult?

354 
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,500
The gods!
An insult to

356 
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,000
If you feel so bad,
Report them to the prefect.

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,200
It might seem that you protecting them.

our disciples.

359 
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,600
You, who are inciting them to be murderers.

360 
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,300
Theon, as director,
you have the last word.

361 
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,800
The insult must to be answered.

362 
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,800
The Jews can do what they
want, is not your battle.

363 
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,400
Ask to your Christians, you would do well
join us with your rank.

364

You will not caused my disciples

00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,500

What if there were simple
explanation about the wanders

502 
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,800
There is.

503 
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,300
But it's so absurd, so old

504

505

What theory is that?

506 
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,800
Theory Aristarchus 

507 
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,400
Aristarchus argued

508 
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,200
that the earth moves.

509 
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,100
The behavior of the wandering

510 
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,100
is only an optical illusion

511 
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,100
produced by our movement

512 
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,400
in combination with his

513 
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>-A heliocentric model.

His work was lost

517 
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,400
in the fire that destroyed
mother's library.

518 
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,200
That's way we have to take great 
care of this place.

519 
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
<i> Our library </ i>

every time dropping an object,

should fall further behind.

529 
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,900
And the wind always blow
against us.

530 
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,900
And the birds would be wipe on.

531 
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,800
I told you

the hypothesis of Aristarchus
that no sense at all.

533

I feel that what you said
be refuted.

But right now I do not know how.

535

640 
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,800
Non sense. Because it is the Sabbath!

641 
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,200
On the Sabbath you should
honor God

in your synagogues
instead stopping yourself

set in theater.

644 
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,200
Therefore I showered stones.

Jesus was a Jew!

650 
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,300
Jesus was Jewish!

651 
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,200
There is .a .something I find

Well,

01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,100
Why Cyril begin
to cleaning up the city?

655 
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,400
is he not satisfied
with what they already have?

656 
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,600
He just wants to scare the Jews.

657 
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,500
but why you say then before..

658 
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,800
What if really interesting.. you
and not them?

659 
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,600
Me?

660 
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,400
Why?
I'm as Christian as he.

661 
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,500
Yes, but forget

662 
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,500
that many of your friends
that circle are not.

663

A full sail, prefect.

664 
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Lets go.

665 
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,800
-Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

666 
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,900
I would like you to take the sack
and flying to top the mast.

667 
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,800
And now, Lady,

668 
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,700
Will you finally tell me what 
the point?

669 
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,100
When Aspasius

670 
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,100
drop the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

671 
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,600
Therefore, the sack

672 
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,400
not fall at the foot of the mast,

673 
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,600
but will fall further back.
About ...

674 
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,600
here.

675 
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,800
And what's so special about that?

676 
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,800
- Yes!
- But You're wrong!

677 
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yes, but this is definitely 
proved

678 
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,700
<i> definitive. The sack </ i>

679 
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,600
has behaved as if
the boat stationary.

680 
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,400
<i> What does that mean? </ i>

681 
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,400
 i do not know.

682 
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,700
But the same principle can 
be applied to the Earth.

683 
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,500
we could be moving around the sun
without our knowledge.

684 
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,400
<i>-Aristarchus.
Exactly. </ I>

685 
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,000
Why are you troubled yourself
by that, Lady?

686 
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,700
Ptolemy <i> not perfect, </ i>

687 
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,400
but it works.

688 
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,600
Orestes, as this with you warrior ...

689 
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,800
A few years ago you was not
so pragmatic, prefect.

690 
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,600
A few years ago i spoke first
before thinking.

691 
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,300
I have Cepheus <i> third. </ i>

692 
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,200
37.

693 
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,200
48.

694 
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,700
Venus and Mars

695 
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,500
share house in Aquarius.

696 
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,600
My father would have celebrated
something like a good wine.

697 
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,400
The stars will not fall.
- Really?

698 
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,200
<i> No, because they are subject
to the hood. </ i>

699 
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,600
<i> The lid opens two heart
and Jesus will appear. </ i>

700 
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,300
What chance for you talking about?

701 
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,100
Do not you know that the universe
is a huge chest, don't you?

702 
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,500
They laid on top
and the Earth ground.

703 
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,700
In this idiot not been told
that the Earth is round!

704 
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:20,500
The Earth is flat.

705 
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,700
Your head is really flat.

706 
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,400
Read the Scriptures!

707 
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,600
If the earth is round,

708 
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,600
Why not the people that live 
in the bottom, fall out?

709 
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,800
What about the one sides?

710 
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,900
Why not slip?

711 
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,200
Think about it.

712 
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,200
Davo knows.

713 
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,700
hi Brother.

714 
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,100
What do you say?

715 
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,100
Does the earth is flat or round?

716 
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,200
Only God knows these things.

717 
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,800
Leave them in the ground!

718 
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,600
Where they are belong!

719 
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,500
Lady, do not despair.

720 
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,200
Today in the boat you make
great progress.

721 
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Why do the wandering very 
that rightness

722 
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,400
so unexpected?

723 
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,500
And what is worse,

724 
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,600
Why does the sun?

725 
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,600
Why is change size
summer to winter?

726 
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,500
Perhaps it's because

727 
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,200
<i> sometimes is nearer </ i>

728 
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,800
and sometimes farther?

729 
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,200
But Aspasia

730 
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,400
watch.

731 
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,500
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

732 
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,200
in the center of everything.

733 
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,300
With us, the Earth,

734 
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,400
traveling in a circle around him.

735 
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,500
Therefore,

736 
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,400
and this is the key

737 
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,800
We are always exactly

738 
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,500
same ...

739 
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,400
distance.

740 
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,700
If, as you say,
accept that changes the distance,

741 
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,600
that forces us to add

742 
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,800
epicycle into orbit
Earth.

743 
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,800
<i> To be closer
and then farther away. </ i>

744 
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,300
Now then we fall
in the same trap as Ptolemy.

745 
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,100
<i>-circles upon circles.
- Exactly! </ I>

746 
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,600
I do not know how to solve
this conflict.

747 
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,800
<i> let me know we can do it </ i>

748 
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,300
<i> if shifting the center  ..well.</ i>

749 
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,500
<i> And not having a center </ i>

750 
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:39,600
My heart, Aspasia.

751 
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,700
So,

752 
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,200
What do we do?

753 
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,000
Resting, lady.

754 
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,200
Parabolans!

755 
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,900

It is a fire.

Where's the fire?

769 
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,100
Jews! It's a trap.

770 
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,700
It's a trap!

771 
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,700
Christians all

772 
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,100
last night is one night was deplorable.

773 
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,400
Now I say to you .

774 
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,200
Grave no longer
for our dead brothers.

775 
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,700
weep not.

776 
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,400
Said you killed for the others,

777 
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,300
but they are executioners.

778 
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,700
Yes, yes.

779 
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,700
Weep for them.
Then they

780 
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,000
they know neither God,

781 
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,500
neither love nor holiness.

782 
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:08,700
I do not know.

783 
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,600
because in this day

784 
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,100
who repeated the Scriptures
without understanding at all.

785

It is they who saw
only a man

God has already condemned.

Now whole the Jews
want revenge!

802 
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,100
I'm afraid you do not understand

Why do not more soldiers
on the streets?

No army can contain

If he defends the Jews,
half the city will rise

But if you do nothing now,

823 
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,100
I believe that Cyril

824 
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,700
will continue do the same thing
over and over again

825

until no people
for this government to govern.

831 
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,900
The Bishop of Cyrene.

832 
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:30,900
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out

833 
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,800
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

834 
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,200
This is where I teach children.

835 
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,300
A cone of Apollonius.

836 
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,700
<i> Yes, I did it to teach
the four corners. </ i>

837 
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,200
<i> Circle, </ i>

838 
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:53,900
the ellipse ...

839 
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:58,400
Orestes and should be here
by now.

840 
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,700
The parabole

841 
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,000
and hyperbola.

842 
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,200
It's beautiful.

843 
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:09,000
Often I look and wonder

844 
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,000
why the circle co axis

845 
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,900
<i> is such impure shapes. </ i>

846 
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,600
What i get to sit here
again

847 
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,200
I bored you.

848 
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:24,000
A long time not do nothing
to hit my head.

849 
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,700
And there are more important issues
to deal with.

850 
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,800
Forgive me.

851 
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,300
Two Christians in the hands
of a pagan.

852 
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,900
It's outrageous!

853 
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,400
outrageous.

854 
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:17,400
- How many?
I do not know, but it will stink.

855 
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:24,900
Ammonium.

856 
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,800
Does God speak to you?

857 
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
All the time.

858 
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:35,100
Ammonium> this, Ammonius that.
Ammonia, Ammonia, Ammonium ...''</ i>

859 
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,600
Today he spooked to me

860 
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,900
<i> so quickly that I had to asking
slow down  </ i>

861 
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,700
Tell me something.

862 
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,600
Did you ever think
what is taken?

863 
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:51,400
Why?

864 
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:58,600
who's forgiven,

865 
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,900
but now,
I can not forgive.

866 
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,600
Forgive?

867 
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,400
Who?

868 
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:10,800
Jews?

869 
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,300
Jesus forgave on the cross.

870 
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,600
Jesus was God

871 
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,800
and only he can show
such leniency.

872 
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:27,200
How dare you
to compare yourself to God?

873 
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,300
Brother.

874 
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,400
You're still alive.

875 
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,700
Why?

876 
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,400
Because it was

877 
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,000
His will save us
on the stones.

878 
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,500
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

879 
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,100
To believe in that belief?

880 
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,400
My Lord ...

881 
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,500
<i> Cyril is very proud man. </ i>

882 
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Agree to meet but will not discuss
the Jews, only discuss peace.

883 
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,500
Peace?

884 
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,300
My suggestion, as your humble adviser
in this case,

885 
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,200
<i> you accept. </ i>

886 
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,400
Let peace be the first.

887 
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,600
Lady, what do you think?
No..I ...

888 
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,400
It does not seem very encouraging.

889 
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,100
Why would I want to come
to see Orestes

890 
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,800
<i>-without concrete proposals?
something else </ I>

891 
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,700
He want come to you.

892 
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,700
Demands that you see in the Library

893 
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,200
during the service on Sunday.

894 
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,700
In the Library?
Why?

895 
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,800
Only Christians have entered
there since its looting.

896 
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
It is a provocation!

897 
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,500
<i> I'll make a suggestion. </ i>

898 
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,800
If you think that your presence

899 
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,200
so essential

900 
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,300
Why not let you baptize?

901 
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,000
Most of us,
beginning

902 
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,800
<i> by the prefect,
have accepted Christ. </ i>

903 
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:22,900
Why not the rest of you?

904 
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,000
only a matter of time and you know it!

905 
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,300
Really?

906 
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,500
Is it only a matter of time?

907 
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:32,900
Excuse me,

908 
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,800
Honorable Member
but far time away..

909 
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,100
your God has not yet proved

910 
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,400
more judge or more compassionate
than their predecessors.

911 
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,200
Lady.

912 
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,000
<i> Is it really just a matter of time
before I accept your faith? </ i>

913 
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,400
Why, then,

914 
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,500
should this assembly

915 
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:53,400
accept the consult of
someone who ability dilution

916 
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,600
absolutely nothing?

917 
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,500
I believe in philosophy.

918 
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,800
Philosophy.

919 
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,200
Just what we need

920 
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,100
in such times.

921 
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,400
Enough!

922 
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,200
I've been studying

923 
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,400
absolutely no life.
for my own

924 
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:30,800
And I wonder

925 
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,600
wow.
- Forget about what i said today.

926 
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,700
Is all
life holds for me?

927 
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:45,100
What else?

928 
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:48,600
I doubt anyone can see 

929 
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:50,200
as devoted wife

930 
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,400
and mother.

931 
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,300
I think ...

932 
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,800
I think the whole city
know the history of the handkerchief.

933 
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,500
So ...

934 
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,800
My father loved that one.

935 
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,700
Even <i> he ...</ i>

936 
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,300
Who have the loved?

937 
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,100
Except you,

938 
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,400
Lebanon.

939 
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:32,100
If only I could ...

940 
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,400
fathom this ...

941 
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,000
a little more.

942 
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:47,000
<i> And get a little closer

943

Why?

946 
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,300
Why that's mean so much to you?

947 
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,400
Right now,

948 
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,300
this every second,
whole earth could be moving

949 
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,500
and no one realized it.

950 
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,100
<i> Except you and me </ i>

951 
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,500
Believe me Lady, it's best
that nobody notices.

952 
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,200
Really not it important?

953 
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,800
i Do not understand why you insist
moving the ground they walk on.

954 
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,100
Dress yourself
what happened on the boat.

955 
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,100
Yes i dit,But that does not mean
this sailing on the earth moves.

956 
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,400
<i> What if it does </ i>

957 
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Hypatia, look around.

01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:34,500
Death,

959 
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:35,900
horror

960 
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,400
destruction.

961 
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,200
<i> If the stars move in

963 
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,500

In circle.

965 
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,800
We do not move ...

<i> circle. </ i>

967

We move in circles.

968 
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,400
Since Plato,

969 
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,200
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

970 
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,100
all have tried
reconcile their observations

<i> with circular orbits. </ i>

972

<i> but What happen

973 
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,500
Another way?

974 
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,700
Lady, There is no purer than the
circle, you yourself have taught us.

975 
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,800
I know, but suppose

976 
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,100
that the purity

977 
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,900
the circle
prevented us from seeing beyond.

978 
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,100
Just like the sunshine
prevents us from seeing

979 
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,800
stars.

980 
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,900
I must begin again

981 
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,400
with new eyes.

982 
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,100
I have to rethink everything.

983 
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,600
All.

984 
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,600
Reading the first letter
Paul to Timothy.

985 
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,600
I therefore wish
that everywhere

986 
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:12,200
men would lift their prayers

987 
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,800
without anger or disputes.

988 
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,400
Equally,

989 
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,000
that women desire

990 
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,500
dress modestly,

991 
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,400
decency and propriety

992 
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,000
without braids in her hair

993 
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,100
or gold or pearls

994 
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,100
or expensive clothes,

995 
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,500
-but with good deeds.''
- Why read this passage?

996 
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:43,300
I do not know, I promise
which is not agreed.

997 
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,300
Let the woman learn

998 
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,700
<i> quiet and full submission,

01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,500
<i> of the same circle </ i>

1163 
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,100
That is impossible, mistress.

1164 
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,900
wait what we know about the circle?
We know that center of the circles

1165 
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:57,700
<i> is always same distance to any point
its perimeter. </ i>

1166 
01:38:57,900 --> 01:38:58,900
<i> Exactly.
Yes. </ I>

1167 
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:00,600
What if the center divided into two

1168 
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:05,800
<i> but keep constant the sum
distances to its perimeter </ i>

1169 
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:11,200
Okay, I'll show you what.
As I move this rod along

1170 
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,500
the rope,
a segment increases

1171 
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:15,800
and the other decreases.
And vice versa.

1172 
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:18,900
Thus the sum of the two always..

1173 
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:21,000
constant. You see that?

1174 
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,600
We apply this, to the movement

1175 
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,900
Earth?

1176 
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,600
What ...

1177 
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,900
will be ...

1178 
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:49,300
obtained ?

1179 
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,100
An ellipse!

1180 
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,300
<i> An ellipse with the sun
in one focus. </ i>

1181 
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,300
Because,

1182 
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:03,600
<i> what is the circle but </ i>

1183 
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,700

1184 
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:09,400

1186 
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,800
i mean That is, what is this?
Maybe i just .. ..

1187 
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,700
Perhaps you ...

1188 
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,000
What do you think?

1189 
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,600
This could be solved, mistress.

1190 
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,900
Well done, we will
with this tomorrow.

1191 
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:55,000
Get some sleep.

1192 
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,500
Good night, mistress.
Good night.

1193 
01:40:58,700 --> 01:40:59,800
Thank you.

1194 
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,200
Davo!

1195

Davo!

Let me see.

1199 
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,500
Why do not you sit down?

1200 
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:54,500
Where is everybody?

1201 
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,100
Please sit down.

All the dignitaries

that have not yet embraced
Christian faith

1206 
01:43:11,900 --> 01:43:13,800

1208 
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,000

You speak of battling faith.

Okay.

Okay.

It's seem already decided, I do not understand

Yes

All three of us, we are good people!

Well ...

1234 
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,500

The palace. Thank you.
-Get out of here.

Who was that?

1256

<i> - How many of you have a knife?

Whatever we threw Orestes

<i> I'll stay with her. </ i>

She has fainted. 

1297 
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,900
The body of Hipatia was mutilated
and the remains...

1298 
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,900
...were dragged through the streets 
and burned in a fire.

1299 
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:30,900
Orestes was outlawed forever 
and Cirilo...

1300 
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,900
...took control of the power
in Alexandria.

1301 
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:41,900
Later, Cirilo was declared a Saint
and Doctor of the Church.

1302 
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,900
Although not any of Hipatia works 
remains,

1303 
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:50,900
it is known that she was an 
exceptional astronomer,

1304 
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:53,800
well-known for the mathematical 
study of conical curves.

1305 
01:53:58,900 --> 01:54:00,900
One thousand, two hundred years later,

1306 
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:02,900
in the 17th century, astronomer
Johannes Kepler...

1307 
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:04,900
...described that one of those curves,...

1308 
01:54:04,900 --> 01:54:06,900
...the ellipse, governs the movement 
of the planets.
